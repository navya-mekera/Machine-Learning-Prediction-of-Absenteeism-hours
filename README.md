# Machine-Learning-Prediction-of-Absenteeism-hours

## Introduction
This project is a study on predicting absenteeism at work. Our objective is - given a set of data points that depicts the frequency of absence due to various health reasons, in a given time period, coupled with absenteeâ€™s personal information such as commute distance, age, children etc., we want to be able to predict the number of hours the employee would be absent for using machine learning algorithms. Having the insight and the ability to predict future absenteeism is useful to developing companies, in the sense that they can make necessary adjustments to changing circumstances in advance, which gives it a competitive advantage in the market.
